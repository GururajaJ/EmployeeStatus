# EmployeeStatus
The Employee Status Management System is a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React (with Hooks) for the frontend. This project is designed to help organizations efficiently manage employee records, including their personal details, roles, and current work status. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) employee data with a seamless and responsive user interface. The backend is powered by RESTful APIs with Spring Data JPA for database interaction, while the frontend offers a dynamic and user-friendly interface for smooth interaction. PostgreSQL is used for persistent storage. This project demonstrates clean architecture, proper state management, and follows modern development practices for building scalable enterprise applications.
